  <h3><em>Work at Rooh'd Life</em></h3>
  <p>Rooh'd Life is an idea that was set in motion by the vision and commitment of two individuals.</p>
  <p>My colleague, <a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/arati-kedia-a86472140"><strong><em>Arati Kedia</em></strong></a> is the co-founder and co-creator of Rooh'd Life
    and is someone who contributes immeasurably to the development and facilitation of all of its workshops and programmes.</p>
  <p>From the beginning we have been united by our goal, viz. to reach out, inform, educate, empower, spread awareness about mental health and psycho-social well-being and offer evidence-based approaches to getting
    <strong><em>Rooh'd, "the process of becoming calm, joyous and self-actualized."</em></strong></p>
